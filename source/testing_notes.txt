chapter 2 Building your first applications

- Building your first applications
    - observations: listed as an example but it is not present as a section

- 01 Improving the scaffolding application
    2011-10-12
    - observations:
        - changed property name in db.py at line 24 from ...field to ...fields
        - had to change production value to False (the app was not finding the table auth_user when inserting a record)
        - removed pool_size from the call to DAL (see next item)
        - The app outputs debugging warnings (with pool_size set to 20):
            DEBUG_c: Exception (<type 'exceptions.Exception'>, OperationalError('Error creating function',))
        - After a while using the app (for example going to the register action), it raises an exception:

            Traceback (most recent call last):
            File "/home/alan/web2py-hg/gluon/restricted.py", line 194, in restricted
                exec ccode in environment
            File "/home/alan/web2py-hg/applications/improving_the_scaffolding_application/models/db.py", line 5, in <module>
                db = DAL(settings.db_uri,pool_size=20)
            File "/home/alan/web2py-hg/gluon/dal.py", line 4182, in __init__
                raise RuntimeError, "Failure to connect, tried %d times:\n%s" % (attempts, error)
            RuntimeError: Failure to connect, tried 5 times:
            Error creating function

            both issues seem to solve removing the pool_size argument in the call to DAL (if production is True)

- 02 Building a simple contacts application.
    2011-10-12
    - observations:
        - changed html end tag for markmin

- 03 Building a Reddit clone
    2011-10-12
    - observations:
        - Line 1961 default.py is not marked as the source py module (to copy the code to)
        - Line 2122 categories.html view is duplicated (should be removed)
        - changed template value news.url to news.link in news.html
        - news_comments.html vote ajax call is not accepted by the controller because it is not detected as POST request.
        - fixed property name http_method to request_method (ajax didn't work) in default.py vote() action

- 04 Building a Facebook Clone
    2011-10-12
    - observations:
        ¿line 2198 file "models" is db.py?


- 05 Using crud.archive
    2011-10-12
    - observations:

- 07 Creating semi-static pages (flatpages)
    2011-10-13
    - observations:
        created the app and added a record counter at the end of the action setup_flatpage
        line 2705 modified indentation in if elif else structure for edit messages. file flatpages.py
        setup_flatpage creates en language records, so when client language is other pages are not found (should be warned in the book)

- 08 Adding your custom logo
    2011-10-13
    - observations:
        created the app and added a logo image (web2py logo_lb)

- 11 Creating a Navigation Bar
    2011-10-13

- 12 Using cookies to set the language
    2011-10-13
    - observations:
        two alternative layout.html files in source folder

- 13 Designing modular applications
    2011-10-13
    - observations:
        incomplete
        line 3224 default.py: display_changes is display_changed
        line 3221 onaccept event passes an object (named it form)
        still, the list of items created does not update automatically

    - observations: created the app

- 02 Creating a model from a csv file
    2011-10-13
    - observations:
        created the app
        the csvstudio.py script creates the table and adds lines to the model with the syntax:

        ### 0
        field1=value, field2=value, ...

        so the file needs cleanup before copying to the apps model.

        created the app
        corrected table name in imported.py

    - observations:
    created the app
    changed the code at line 3835. table "tag" in query changed to "link"
    added code to the controller for user input (there was not controller or view code)

- 07 Accessing you database from multiple applications
    2011-10-13
    - observations:
        no app created
        connection string with postgres does not allow migrations? (both apps must have migration_enabled = False)
        the python script for metadata returns an empty list ([])

- 08 Hierarchical Category Tree

    - observations:
    created app and added controller code
    corrected indentation in for loop and changed class name error in line 3992
    the app stops in action default/tree with the following error:

    Traceback (most recent call last):

        The second part of the recipe is not working (no autocomplete list returned)

        In the book should say:

            Before the include "web2py_ajax.html" in layout.html place the following code:

            <script type="text/javascript">
            var app_loading_image = '{{ =IMG(_src=URL("static","images/loading.gif"), _alt="loading") }}';
            </script>

        Then, the jQuery sentence in ajax() must be changed to:

        IMPORTANT: CHECK LEGAL ISSUES ABOUT PUBLICATION OF FACEBOOK SCRIPT

        tested without fb api registration
        on login action the app shows a JSON text:

            {
            "error": {
                "message": "Error validating application.",

################################################################

notes
- a_b_c app name convention does not look good in the scaffolding app default titles

skipped apps:
chapter 02: modular, section 13 (incomplete)
replace :code_html (templates) with :code_web2py

Chapter 8 - 4 "...Multiuser..." has no code (except a line in 0.py)

routes recipes were tested with app installer only when needed (the most of them can be tested with web2py routes.py parameters)
Chapter 9 .w2p installers do not include the routes.py parameters wich can be copied from the source folders. (a workaround can be using local application routes files.)
